# [Demo](http://erikdemaine.org/attractor/)

[The demo site](http://erikdemaine.org/attractor/)
provides interactive demos illustrating grid orthogonal
polygons for which a magnetic <b>beacon</b>, constrained to be outside the
polygon, cannot capture a steel <b>ball</b>, which tries to move as
straight as possible toward the beacon but is constrained to remain inside
the polygon.
You can play the levels with arrow keys,
or ask the app to search for a solution via BFS.
This website is a companion to
<a href="http://jasonku.mit.edu/pdf/BEACON_JCDCGGG.pdf">our JCDCGGG 2018 paper</a>
which provides the context for the problem
and proves formally that these examples are indeed unsolvable.
This repository provides the source code for this demo site.
